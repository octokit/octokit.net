# Debugging Octokit Source in your app

As of version 0.6, Octokit supports symbol debugging - this enables you to step
into the Octokit source without having the repository on your local machine.

### Enable Symbol Debugging

To enable this, you need to enable this in VS:

 - From the top **Tools** menu, select **Options**
 - Select **Debugging** from the left sidebar and expand **General**

Ensure you have checked **Enable source server support**:

### How does this actually work?

When you hit a breakpoint in your application, you can step into the
Octokit source code using `F11`. This will retrieve the source file associated
with a specific type, and cache it in your local symbols cache.

You can then set subsequent breakpoints inside the source code, to return to
in the debugging session.

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Cameron Taggart for the initial implementation and the .NET foundation for ongoing support of [SourceLink](https://github.com/dotnet/sourcelink) which we use to provide source debugging.
