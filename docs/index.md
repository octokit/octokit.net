# Octokit.net

If you are new to Octokit, I recommend reading the
[Getting Started](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)
guide, which walks through configuring the basics.

When you're done with that, have a look at the topics listed under **Features** to get
an idea of what other things are available.

If you're looking for some real-world examples, check out the **Samples** section.

There's also some advanced topics which require familiarity with the internals of Octokit.
You shouldn't need to know these well, but they're there if there comes a day when you do.

If we still haven't covered a topic you're interested in,  check out the suite of 
[integration tests](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/tree/master/Octokit.Tests.Integration/Clients)
which can help you to get familiar with how things currently work. Then open an issue
against the repository, so we can properly document things.
