### New in 0.27.0 (released 7/10/2017)

## Advisories and Breaking Changes

- `NewTeam.Permission` has been changed to a nullable type `Permission?` and will no longer be sent unless explicitly set

## Release Notes

**Features/Enhancements**

**Fixes**

- Assembly versioning, NuGet package metadata and inter-package version dependencies should now be correct, after automating them via the build process - [#1660](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/pull/1660) via [@ryangribble](https://github.com/ryangribble), [@mderriey](https://github.com/mderriey)
- Octokit can now run in environments where `PlatformNotSupported` exception was encountered when initializing the API connection (eg AWS Lambda) - [#1660](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/pull/1660) via [@ryangribble](https://github.com/ryangribble), [@mderriey](https://github.com/mderriey)
- Intellisense should once again be available for Octokit libraries - sorry about that! - [#1674](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/pull/1674) via [@mderriey](https://github.com/mderriey)

- BranchProtection response class `EnforceAdmins` now provides a standard `ctor` allowing it to be mocked if required - [#1679](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/pull/1679) via [@ryangribble](https://github.com/ryangribble)


### New in 0.26.0 (released 31/8/2017)

## Advisories and Breaking Changes

- This release contains the necessary Octokit changes to specify the `required_pull_request_reviews` field on Branch Protection updates, which becomes mandatory when the Protected Branches API [graduates from preview mode](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-06-16-loki-preview-ending-soon/) on the 1st September

## Release Notes

**Features/Enhancements**

- Implement `RequiredPullRequestReviews` support in `IRepositoryBranchesClient.UpdateBranchProtection` and additional granular methods to `GetReviewEnforcement`, `UpdateReviewEnforcement` and `RemoveReviewEnforcement` via [@M-Zuber](https://github.com/M-Zuber), [@ryangribble](https://github.com/ryangribble)

### New in 0.25.0 (released 23/8/2017)

## Advisories and Breaking Changes

- Octokit.net has been ported to dotnetcore :tada: providing libraries targetting `netstandard1.1` and `net45` frameworks

- `Enum` fields in Octokit response classes are now wrapped in an `StringEnum<TEnum>` helper class, to provide more robustness in dealing with unknown API values for these fields.  Whilst the changes are backwards compatible, please consult the guidance on [working with Enums](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/blob/master/docs/working-with-enums.md) for more information

- `IncludeAdmins` field is no longer present in `BranchProtectionRequiredStatusChecks` and `BranchProtectionRequiredStatusChecksUpdate` classes, instead use the new `EnforceAdmins` field on `BranchProtectionSettingsUpdate` or the [new explicit methods](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/blob/master/Octokit/Clients/IRepositoryBranchesClient.cs#L304-L365) for configuring Admin Enforcement on protected branches.  This was an [upstream API breaking change](https://developer.github.com/changes/2017-05-02-adoption-of-admin-enforced/) so we couldn't follow our normal deprecation schedule

 - Unparseable `ApiErrors` should now fall back to better default error messages - [#1540](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/pull/1540) via [SeanKilleen](https://github.com/SeanKilleen)

**Fixes**

 - Fix errors in `ObservableEventsClient` caused by incorrect return types - [#1490](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/pull/1490) via [StanleyGoldman](https://github.com/StanleyGoldman)

 - Clarify label coloring usage in docs - [#1530](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.net/pull/1530) via [SeanKilleen](https://github.com/SeanKilleen)

**Breaking Changes**

 - Creating and Editing Issues (and PullRequests) using `NewIssue` and `IssueUpdate` requests 
should now use the `Assignees` collection rather than the now deprecated 'Assignee` field. 
Both fields can't be specified on the same request, so any code still using `Assignee` will 
need to explicitly set `Assignees` to `null` to avoid Api validation errors.

 - `OrganizationsClient.GetAll(string user)` has been marked obsolete in favour of 
`OrganizationsClient.GetAllForUser(string user)`

 - `PullRequest.Comment` has been marked obsolete in favour of `PullRequest.ReviewComment`

- Several `EventsClient` methods previously returned the incorrect `Activity` response class. 
This has been corrected to `IssueEvent` which although is now correct could break calling 
code that was written assuming this previous incorrect return type.

### New in 0.23.0 (released 07/10/2016)

**Features**

 - Added support to test whether a URL points to a GitHub Enterprise instance - #1404 via @haacked
 - Added granular methods for Protected Branches preview API - #1443 via @maddin2016
 - Repository Traffic preview API support - #1457 via @maddin2016
 - Preview API for merge/squash/rebase in repository settings - #1477 via @ryangribble
 - Added support for performing a rebase and merge through the API- #1479 via @ryangribble

**Fixes**

 - Repository identifiers now use `long` instead of `int` - #1445 via @shana, #1485 via @ryangribble
 - Searching for C# through the GitHub API now uses the correct alias - #1463 via @dampir
 - Resolved deadlocking scenario in async/await usage - #1486 via @zzzprojects

**Other**

 - LINQPad samples are now verified at build time - #1456 via @mderriey
 - More obsolete APIs removed - #1458 via @ryangribble
 - .NET Core support has been started - #1462 via @mderriey

**Breaking Changes**

Repository identifiers returned from the GitHub API will exceed `Int32.MaxValue` in
around 12 months, based on current growth. We've decided to update everywhere we
require (or return) a repository identifier from `int` to `long` so that these will
continue to work in the future, and the implicit conversion from `int` to `long`
means the impact should be manageable now.

`MergePullRequest.Squash` has been marked as obsolete in favour of the `MergeMethod`
property - use `PullRequestMergeMethod.Squash` or `PullRequestMergeMethod.Rebase` if
you want to change the merge behaviour when merging a pull request.

### New in 0.22.0 (released 2016/09/01)

**Features**

 - Timeline preview API support - #1435 via @alfhenrik
 - Initial groundwork for Branches API - #1437 via @ryangribble
 - Base branch can now be updated when updating a pull request - #1450 via @ryangribble
 - Enhancements to Protected Branches preview API - #1441 via @ryangribble

**Fixes**

 - Redirect timeout when repository renamed - #1411 via @maddin2016

**Breaking Changes**

The new Branches client added in #1437 means that existing methods on 
I(Observable)RepositoryClient are now marked as obsolete. Please update your
usages to the new endpoints as these will be removed in a future release:

 - `client.Repository.GetBranch()` => `client.Repository.Branch.Get()`
 - `client.Repository.GetAllBranches()` => `client.Repository.Branch.GetAll()`
 - `client.Repository.EditBranch()` => `client.Repository.Branch.Edit()`

There is also a change in how branch protection works with the API, due to 
upstream changes. The existing methods have been marked as obsolete, but for
the sake of brevity here are the details about what you should be doing today.

The process for inspecting branch protection is now two steps:

 - first, check the branch returned by `client.Repository.Branch.Get()` or 
   `client.Repository.Branch.GetAll()` has it's `Protected` property set to `true`.

 - then, a call to `client.Repository.Branch.GetBranchProtection()` will return
   the details about the protection settings for the given branch. If no protection
   is set for this branch, you will received a `HTTP 404` response.

### New in 0.21.1 (released 2016/07/29)

**Features**

Due to a programming error in the tool to generate these release notes, additional
features were not properly documented for the previous release:

 - Reactions preview API support for issues, issue comments, commit comments and PR comments - #1335, #1341, #1405 via @maddin2016, @alfhenrik 
 - Repository Invitation preview API support - #1410 via @maddin2016
 - Added new fields for signature verification to Git Data Commit API - #1398 via @Sarmad93

No additional code changes have been made to this release.

### New in 0.21.0 (released 2016/07/29)

**Features**

This release adds support across Octokit.net for providing the repository Id
rather than a name/owner pair. The repository Id does not change when transferring
ownership of a repository, and is more robust for API callers. This work
was lead by @dampir as part of Google Summer of Code 2016.

 - Added new fields for Deployment and DeploymentStatus preview API - #1365 via @ErikSchierboom
 - Added new fields for signature verification to Git Data Tag API - #1420 via @Sarmad93
 - Added new fields for GitHub Pages preview API - #1421 via @dampir

**Fixes**

 - Fix serialization of enum value attributes - #1402 via @maddin2016
 - Fix searching for repositories with underscore in name - #1418 via @dsplaisted, @shiftkey

**Other**

 - Clarified obsolete warnings for Protected Branch preview API - #1428 via @ryangribble
 - Remove Obsolete items - #1422 via @ryangribble

**Breaking Changes**

After a long grace period, #1422 has removed these obsoleted members. These features
exist in other parts of the API surface:

 - `I(Observable)GitHubClient.Release`
 - `I(Observable)GitHubClient.Notification`
 - `I(Observable)GitHubClient.GitDatabase`
 - `I(Observable)GitHubClient.SshKey`
 - `I(Observable)GitHubClient.Repository.RepositoryComments`
 - `I(Observable)GitHubClient.Repository.CommitStatus`
 - `I(Observable)GitHubClient.Repository.RepoCollaborators`
 - `I(Observable)GitHubClient.Repository.Commits`

This method is no longer supported through the API and has been removed from Octokit.net.: 

 - `I(Observable)GitHubClient.Authorization.RevokeAllApplicationAuthentications()`

### New in 0.20.0 (released 2016/06/15)

**Features**

The big focus for this release is pagination support. This lets the caller
control how much data to retrieve for `GetAll*` endpoints throughout Octokit.
This was a team effort to apply this across the entire codebase, with
contributions from @dampir, @devkhan, @prayankmathur, @SamTheDev and @shiftkey.

For more information about how to use pagination in your projects refer to the
documentation: http://octokitnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensibility/#pagination

 - Add Migrations preview API - #1141 via @devkhan
 - Add Issue Lock/Unlock functionality - #1185 via @prayankmathur

 - Add additional methods to `IEventsClient` - #1288 via @drasticactions
 - Add Organization Permissions preview API - #1342 via @ryangribble
 - Add GPG Keys preview API - #1343 via @alfhenrik
 
**Fixes**

 - Renamed `IUserKeysClient.GetAll()` to `IUserKeysClient.GetAllForCurrent()` - #1139 via @M-Zuber
 - Add `ItemStateFilter` enum to differentiate between search and list endpoints - #1140 via @prayankmathur
 - `RepositoriesClient.GetAllPublic()` fails for Enterprise instanes due to URI structure - #1204 via @ryangribble 
 - `ConfigureAwait(false)` usages added, eliminating deadlocks - #1248 via @shiftkey
 - Renamed `CompareResult.MergedBaseCommit` to fix serialization issue - #1265 via @kivancmuslu

 - Add required Permission parameter to team management APIs - #1347 via @ryangribble
 - Add `ClosedBy` property to `Issue` - #1353 via @maddin2016

**Other**
 
 - Deleting now-obsolete code - #1224 via @M-Zuber
 - Centralize and cleanup the `Uri`s created in Octokit - #1287, #1290 via @dampir
 - Updated documentation links - #1289 via @radu-matei, #1250 via @SamTheDev 
 
**Breaking Changes**

 - `IUserKeysClient.GetAll()` was named incorrectly when it was originally implemented
   and only works for the current user's keys. Update all usages to `GetAllForCurrent()`.

 - `CompareResult.MergedBaseCommit` was never deserialized correctly, and has
   been marked as obsolete. You should use `CompareResult.MergeBaseCommit`
   instead (note the lack of a `d`).

 - `IEventsClient.GetAllForRepository` was incorrectly retrieving issue
    events before this release. Use the new `IEventsClient.GetAllIssuesForRepository`
    method if you still require issues, or continue to use `IEventsClient.GetAllForRepository`
    if you require all repository events.

 - `IUsersClient` has a property named `Keys` which has been renamed in the
   GitHub API documentation - Octokit has added the name `GitSshKey` to
   reflect this change, and `Keys` will be removed in a later release.

**Breaking Changes**

`ISshKeysClient` has a number of methods which at the time should have been
implemented in `IUserKeysClient` - these methods are marked as obsolete and will
be removed in a future release:

 - `ISshKeysClient.Get(int id)`
 - `ISshKeysClient.GetAll(string user)`
 - `ISshKeysClient.GetAllForCurrent()`
 - `ISshKeysClient.Create(SshKeyUpdate key)`
 - `ISshKeysClient.Update(int id, SshKeyUpdate key)`
 - `ISshKeysClient.Delete(int id)`

**Breaking Changes:**

As part of reaching 1.0 we went through to audit the current implementation
and identify areas that didn't align with our conventions. For this release,
we're marking the endpoints as `[Obsolete]` and indicating the new location.
These will be cleaned up in the next release:

 - `IGitHubClient.Notifications` -> `IGitHubClient.Activity.Notifications` - #1019 via @M-Zuber
 - `IGitHubClient.Repository.CommitStatus` -> `IGitHubClient.Repository.Status` - #1043 via @RobPethick
 - `IGitHubClient.Repository.Commits` -> `IGitHubClient.Repository.Commit` - #1057 via @M-Zuber
 - `IGitHubClient.Repository.RepoCollaborators` -> `IGitHubClient.Repository.Collaborator` - #1040 via @M-Zuber
 - `IGitHubClient.Repository.RepositoryComments` -> `IGitHubClient.Repository.Comment` - #1044 via @M-Zuber
 - `IGitHubClient.Release` -> `IGitHubClient.Repository.Release` - #1058 via @RobPethick
 - `IGitHubClient.GitDatabase` -> `IGitHubClient.Git` - #1048 via @RobPethick

Other breaking changes:

 - a public `ApiExtensions.Get<T>` extension method was causing a bunch of
   tests to be written in a confusing way. This has been ported to an interface
   method on `IApiConnection` but hopefully you're not referencing this method
   externally - see #1063 for more information.

 - `IRepositoryContentsClient.GetArchiveLink` is no longer correct, as the HTTP
   behaviour in Octokit was updated to follow redirects received from the server.
   See #986 for the last bits of cleanup.

 - `IRepositoryContentsClient.GetAllContents(string owner, string name, string path, string reference)`
   has been renamed to `GetAllContentsByRef(string owner, string name, string path, string reference)`
   to prevent overlap with methods on `IRepositoryContentsClient` which do not
   specify a path - and thus look at the root of the repository.

 - `IssueEventPayload` has two fields which are never populated from the API -
   `Assignee` and `Label` - these are now removed. You should use
   `Issue.Assignee` and `Issue.Labels` instead. See #1039 for more details.

 - `PullRequest.MergeCommitSha` is marked as obsolete by the GitHub API - we
    are cleaning up the behaviour for determining whether a PR has been
    merged in #997 - see the PR for more information.

 - `IAuthorizationsClient.RevokeAllApplicationAuthentications` is no longer
   available through the GitHub API - this will be removed in the next
   release.

**Shout outs**

A lot of extra work went into this release, and I wanted to thank those people
who helped out - without their efforts we wouldn't be at this point:

   Mono - see #995 for the details
 - @hahmed - for contributing a bunch of documentation around the Octokit search
   APIs - see #955, #954 and #951

**Breaking Changes:**
 - `NewDeployment` constructor requires a ref as this is required for the API. It no longer has a default constructor.

* Fixed: `TeamClient.AddMembership` sends correct parameter to server - #856 via @davidalpert
* Obsolete: `Authorization` endpoint which does not require fingerprint - #878 via @niik

**Breaking Changes:**

   are now of type `RepositoryCollection` so that multiple repositories can be searched.
 - The workarounds removed in #878 were added initially to support transitioning, but now
   we enforce the use of a fingerprint. See https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth_authorizations/
   for more details.

* Fixed: renamed methods to follow `GetAll` convention - #771 via @alfhenrik
* Fixed: helper functions and cleanup to make using Authorization API easier to consume - #786 via @haacked

**Breaking Changes:**
 - As part of #771 there were many method which were returning collections
   but the method name made it unclear. You might think that it wasn't much, but
   you'd be wrong. So if you have a method that no longer compile,
   it is likely that you need to set the prefix to `GetAll` to re-disocver that API.
 - `CommitComment.Position` is now a nullable `int` to prevent serialization issues.

 - `ReleaseUpdate` no longer requires a `TagName` in the constructor (see `NewRelease`)

     set these if you want to apply changes to the API
