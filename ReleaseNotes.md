### New in 0.5.2 (Released 2014/10/13)
* New: Method to add repository to team - #546 via @kevfromireland
* Fixed: PATCH parameters for releases, issues and pull requests are now nullable - #561 via @thedillonb

**Breaking Changes:**

 - `PullRequestUpdate` removed unused fields: `Number`, `State`, `Base`, and `Head`
 - `ReleaseClient.Create` now accepts a `NewRelease` parameter (was `ReleaseUpdate`)
 - `ReleaseUpdate` no longer requires a `TagName` in the constructor (see `NewRelease`)
 - `ReleaseUpdate` now has nullable `Draft` and `Prerelease` properties - only
     set these if you want to apply changes to the API
 - `IssueUpdate.State` is now a nullable `ItemState`
 - `MilestoneUpdate.Number` is now removed
 - `MilestoneUpdate.State` is now a nullable `ItemState`

**Breaking Change:** `Readme.GetHtmlContent()` would return a 404, due to `Readme.HtmlUrl` not accepting custom Accepts header. This method now uses `Readme.Url` internally, which will return a slightly different DOM.
